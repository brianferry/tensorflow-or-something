# Quality Mode Caching Issue - SOLUTION

## Problem Description
When setting the TensorFlow agent to `quality` mode, it was returning the same cached response every time instead of generating fresh AI responses using remote ML models.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was **not a bug in the caching logic**, but rather **incorrect API usage**:

1. **Missing performance mode setting**: The user was calling `/api/run_task/` without first setting the performance mode to `quality`
2. **Default mode behavior**: The agent defaults to `balanced` mode, which has caching enabled
3. **Cache persistence**: Cached responses from `balanced` mode were being returned even when expecting `quality` mode behavior

## Technical Details

### Quality Mode Configuration
```javascript
quality: {
    useAdvancedNLP: true,
    useSentiment: true,
    useML: true,
    useRemoteModels: true,
    maxAnalysisDepth: 3,
    cacheEnabled: false,  // ← This disables caching
    responseStyle: 'detailed'
}
```

### Cache Logic Fix
The original cache check had redundant logic:
```javascript
// BEFORE (redundant)
if (this.config.cacheEnabled && this.performanceMode !== 'quality') {

// AFTER (simplified)
if (this.config.cacheEnabled) {
```

Since `quality` mode has `cacheEnabled: false`, the extra check was unnecessary.

## SOLUTION - Correct API Usage

### Step 1: Set Performance Mode
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://your-app.vercel.app/api/set_performance_mode/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Cookie: _vercel_jwt=your_jwt_token' \
  --data-raw '{"mode":"quality"}'
```

### Step 2: Make Task Request
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://your-app.vercel.app/api/run_task/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Cookie: _vercel_jwt=your_jwt_token' \
  --data-raw '{"task":"Info on Eevee evolutions"}'
```

## Verification

In quality mode, you should see:
- ✅ `"cached": false` in API responses
- ✅ Different/fresh responses on each call
- ✅ Longer processing times (ML model usage)
- ✅ More detailed response content

## Key Points

1. **Always set performance mode first** before making task requests
2. **Quality mode automatically disables caching** for fresh results
3. **The agent persists across Vercel serverless calls**, so mode setting is retained
4. **Different modes have different cache keys** to prevent cross-contamination

## Testing Scripts

Use the provided test scripts to verify:
- `test_quality_mode_fix.sh` - Tests the correct API sequence
- `test_deployed_fix.sh` - Tests the deployed Vercel application

## Files Modified

- `src/agent/tensorflow_agent_serverless.js` - Simplified cache check logic
- Added test scripts and documentation

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The caching logic was working correctly. The issue was user error in API usage sequence. Users must explicitly set performance mode to `quality` before making requests to get non-cached, fresh AI responses.
