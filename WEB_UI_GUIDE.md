# 🎨 Web UI for Testing Performance Modes

## 🚀 Accessing the Test UI

Once your TensorFlow Agent Service is deployed on Replit, you can access the beautiful web UI to test different performance modes!

### 📍 URL Access

1. **Your Replit URL**: `https://your-app.your-username.repl.co`
2. **Test UI**: `https://your-app.your-username.repl.co/test`

### 🎯 Features

The web UI provides an intuitive interface for testing your agent without any technical knowledge required:

#### 🎛️ **Two Testing Modes**
- **Single Mode**: Test one performance mode at a time
- **Compare All**: Test all three modes (Fast, Balanced, Quality) simultaneously

#### ⚡ **Performance Modes**
- **🏃 Fast Mode**: Quick, concise responses (~100-200 characters)
- **⚖️ Balanced Mode**: Natural, conversational responses (~500-1000 characters)  
- **🎓 Quality Mode**: Comprehensive analytical reports (~2000+ characters)

#### 💡 **Built-in Examples**
Click-to-use example queries:
- ⚡ "Tell me about Pikachu for competitive battling"
- 🔥 "What makes Charizard good for competitive play?"
- 🌱 "Show me Bulbasaur type advantages"
- 💧 "Compare Squirtle vs Wartortle stats"
- ⚡ "Tell me about Electric type Pokemon"

#### 📊 **Real-time Results**
- **Response timing** (shows processing speed)
- **Character count** (shows response length)
- **Cache status** (shows if response was cached)
- **Formatted output** (converts markdown to HTML)

## 🎨 UI Design Features

### Beautiful Interface
- **Gradient backgrounds** and modern styling
